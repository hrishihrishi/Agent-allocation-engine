### Security Notice
The dependencies `csvtojson` and `xlsx` currently report known prototype pollution vulnerabilities without available patches.  
These are non-exploitable in this project context (no user-supplied code execution, only admin uploads controlled CSV/XLSX files).  
Monitoring advisories via `npm audit` and SheetJS issue tracker.
